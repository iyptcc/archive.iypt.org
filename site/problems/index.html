<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>The IYPT problems are open-ended and enquiry-based. We are working to clarify how the special, breathtaking features of such problems have been coined.</p>

<p>What we know for certain is that at some point in early 1979, <b>Evgeny Yunosov</b> invited a group of undergraduate students at Moscow University to prepare a problem set for a new contest he was planning to launch on March 17, 1979 (which later grew into the YPT and IYPT.) The students were <b>Andrei Mironov</b>, <b>Anton Zabrodin</b>, <b>Evgeny Ponomaryov</b>, and <b>Petr Tinyakov</b>. “As far as I remember, there were various problems, and some had a specific answer. But the key idea was to offer a field for research. We were certainly influenced by a previous experience, including Kapitsa’s problems”, Anton Zabrodin recalled in August 2012. The new problems were overwhelmingly successful and remained the most vibrant and distinctive feature of the IYPTs ever since.</p>

<p>Before 1994, the IYPT probelms were circulating mostly in Russian. In many cases, no “standard” English editions existed, and not all “standard” Russian editions have been yet found. When re-published or translated in the past, the problems suffered from omissions and inaccuracies, and many problems were even misattributed. This section presents the problems for the early IYPTs, as they are restored from all traced multilingual sources. After 1993, the problems already existed in unique, “standard” English versions, that have been almost continuously <a href="http://homepage.univie.ac.at/heinz.kabelka/problems.html">preserved</a> up to now.</p>

<p>The committee for problem selection would need the early problems for “<a href="http://iypt.org/images/8/85/EC_Oct_2007.pdf">a simple check of possible repeating of problems</a>”, as decided in 2007. The historical IYPT problems, however, are useful for a much wider, global audience. The problems have been repeatedly credited as source of ideas for <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0143-0807/30/6/S04">laboratory tasks</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0031-9120/45/5/008">thematic activities in schools</a>, <a href="http://www2.fysik.org/gymnasiet/gymnasiearbetet/">graduation research projects</a>, or even <a href="http://ilyam.org/Rajkovits_Markovich_Influence_Int_Competitions_Physics_Teaching_(PC_6_1_64-80_2004).pdf">everyday physics teaching</a>.</p>

<p>Our key aim in this section is to provide the <i>critical editions</i> of utmost reliability, by verifying and tracing each IYPT problem back to its original source.</p>

<p align="right"><i>The sciences nourish young people,<br />
Give consolation to the old,<br />
They decorate a happy life,<br />
And they protect one in misfortune...</i><br />
M. V. Lomonosov</p>


<p><b>1. Invent yourself</b><br />Suggest original projects of technical and scientific use of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

<p><b>2. “Eternal radio”</b><br />Develop and construct a portable radio receiver that does not use power supplies. The usability parameter is <i>x=P/Lm</i>, where <i>P</i> is acoustic pressure at a distance of 1 m from the receiver, <i>L</i> is maximum linear dimension, and <i>m</i> is mass of the receiver.</p>

<p><b>3. Camera obscura</b><br />Make a group portrait of your team with a camera obscura. Validate the physical principles of achieving a good quality photograph with such a device.</p>

<p><b>4. Electric circuit</b><br />Several knots (<i>n</i>&#8804;10) are interconnected with batteries of known EMF and <i>r</i>. Create a computer program to calculate the potential difference between the first and the second knot. Consider the time from the start of data input (tables of EMF and <i>r</i> values) to the moment of correct result output, as the quality criterion of the program.</p>

<p><b>5. Metrology</b><br />Determine the maximum precision of length measurement with a steel ruler.</p>

<p><b>6. Seller of vacuum</b><br />An enterprising star farer decided to supply physical laboratories worldwide with vacuum from cosmic space. What are the venture’s chances of being successful?</p>

<p><b>7. Sunset</b><br />The visible Sun disk is flattened at sunset. Measure these distortions experimentally and describe them. Calculate the theoretical ratio of horizontal and vertical dimensions of the Sun disk that is touching the horizon.</p>

<p><b>8. Color television</b><br />You have to construct a four-color television receiver. What colors would you choose as basic? Is it then necessary to modify the image capture equipment?</p>

<p><b>9. Ninth wave</b><br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Before me are the waves of the sea.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many. They are countless.”</i><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Pasternak<br />
Does the “Ninth wave” phenomenon exist? Clarify this question. As a starting point, you can use the ideas from the article “Troika, semyorka, tuz...” (<a href="http://ilyam.org/Troika_1st_IYPT_Znanie-slia_1_1987_97-103.pdf">Znanie — sila, 1987, No. 1, pp. 97—104</a>.)</p>

<p><b>10. Self-ignition</b><br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yet also when a many-branched tree,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing ’gainst branches of a neighbour tree,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There by the power of mighty rub and rub<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fire engendered; and at times out-flares<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the trunks.”</i><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucretius Carus<br />
Thus the Roman philosopher has explained the origin of forest fires. Estimate the probability of such an ignition and its role among the factors that cause fires in nature, i.e. not caused by a human activity.</p>

<p><b>11. Incandescent lamp</b><br />It is said that two 60 W light bulbs shine brighter than three 40 W bulbs. Is it true? Investigate how a small change in supplied voltage will affect light emission and a light bulb’s lifetime.</p>

<p><b>12. Spring in a city</b><br />Spring begins in a city earlier than in the countryside. Describe the main causes of this phenomenon and make numerical estimations. In particular, what would happen if one day all snow from Moscow is removed to the countryside?</p>

<p><b>13. Heat transfer</b><br />Research the heat transfer through the vertical water column in the two cases: <i>T<sub>1</sub>&#60;T<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>1</sub>&#62;T<sub>2</sub></i>.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="1IYPT_1.gif"/><br />
“1” is water column, “2” is heat insulating tube.</p>

<p><b>14. Mesoscopics</b><br />One of the mesoscopic effects is a significant change of the resistance of a two-dimensional metal sample at low temperatures, if just a single atom within the crystal lattice is displaced. This effect can be visually illustrated if one considers the following model: small flat mirrors, with reflection coefficients equal to 1, are placed in the knots of a two-dimensional lattice <i>n</i>&#215;<i>n</i>, <i>n</i>&#62;&#62;1. Each mirror can exist in two positions only; it can be inclined at 45&#176; clockwise or counter-clockwise.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="1IYPT_2.gif"/><br />
The states of the mirrors change chaotically, so the laser beam incident on a lattice knot reflects perpendicularly from the knot in both directions with the same probability. Estimate how the output light power will change if one of the knots is replaced by an absolute light-absorbing element.</p>

<p><b>15. Copper coin</b><br />A 1-kopeck coin “fell out” of a space rocket and became an artificial planet. Estimate its lifetime as of a planet of the Solar System.</p>

<p><b>16. Trapped electrons</b><br />Several electrons (2&#8804;<i>n</i>&#8804;30) can freely move inside a circle of a radius <i>R</i>. What relative position of the electrons is stable?</p>

<p><b>17. Cagliostro’s resistor</b><br />Even a human being is a resistor for a school tester. Investigate the laws of parallel and series circuits with a school tester. (Traditionally, problem No. 17 has a humorous tone.)</p>

<p><b>2. Noon</b><br />Is it possible to call “noon” the moment in the middle of the time interval between sunrise and sunset? Using a calendar, you will easily notice that throughout the year this moment “drifts” relatively to a certain moment of time. Explain the cause of this effect.</p>

<p><b>3. Tides</b><br />Estimate the heights of the tides in the Black Sea on April 1, 1989.</p>

During what time <i>T</i> will the sand flow out of the tube, when the cap is opened? Investigate the dependence of <i>T</i> on the following parameters: size of sand grains <i>d</i>, length of the tube <i>L</i>, diameter of the tube <i>D</i>, at a constant degree of packing of sand (you have to introduce and validate this parameter on your own.) We ask you not to consider high degrees of packing for comparability of the results. It is preferred that 10 cm&#60;<i>L</i>&#60;1 m. </p>

<p><b>13. Electrolytic cell</b><br />Prepare some saturated solution of table salt NaCl. Immerse two carbon electrodes (sticks from manganese-zinc battery <i>373 (R20)</i>) into it so that their metal contacts are not immersed into the solution. Investigate

<p><b>1. Invent yourself</b> — a physical photo contest<br />Submit to a contest the photographs of a rapidly occurring physical phenomenon. Explain in your commentaries the physical value of these photographs.</p>

<p><b>2—4. Ball and piston</b><br />A horizontal piston oscillates up and down. The coordinate of the piston’s surface is defined with an expression <i>x</i>=<i>x<sub>0</sub></i>cos<i>&#969;t</i>. At an arbitrary moment, a small ball is dropped without initial speed onto the piston from a height <i>H</i>.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="2IYPT_1.gif"/><br /></p>

<p><b>2.</b> Up to what altitude will the ball bounce after the first collision with the piston? For this case, consider the collision as absolutely elastic, and <i>H&#62;x<sub>0</sub></i>.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> The system “forgets” the initial conditions after a big number of collisions. Estimate up to what maximum altitude a ball may bounce after many collisions. What is the average bounce altitude? Consider that the surfaces of the ball and of the piston are not damaged at collisions.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Let a ceiling be at a height <i>H</i> above the piston. In this case, stationary solutions are possible. Find some of them and research their stability. Consider <i>H</i>=1 m, <i>H&#62;&#62;x<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>g</i>=10 m/s<sup>2</sup> for numerical estimations. Consider the restoration coefficient of ball collisions with the piston and with the ceiling, as <i>k</i>=0.8.</p>

<p><b>5. Planet</b><br />What is the maximum possible size of a cube-shaped planet?</p>

<p><b>6. Evaporation-condensation</b><br />A П-shaped soldered glass tube contains some water.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="2IYPT_2.gif"/><br />
If there is an initial difference of water levels <i>H</i>, then the water levels will become equal after some time. Estimate the rate of this equalization for a given <i>H</i> and <i>T=const</i>,

<ol type="a"><li>if there is no air in the tube</li>
<li>if there is some air in the tube, at normal atmospheric pressure.</li></ol></p>

<p><b>7. Cylinder in a tube</b><br />A cylinder is moving towards the closed end in a long tube filled with water.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="2IYPT_3.gif"/><br />
The inner diameter of the tube is <i>D</i>, diameter of the cylinder is <i>d</i>, the cylinder length is <i>L</i>, <i>D-d=h</i>, <i>L&#62;D</i>, <i>h&#60;&#60;D</i>. How does the resistance force depend on the speed of cylinder? Compare the theoretical estimations with the experimental results.</p>

<p><b>8. Segner’s wheel</b><br />A Segner’s wheel rotates due to the reactive force of streams flowing out of the nozzles, when the wheel is placed into the water. Will it rotate backwards in a reverse regime, if the water is sucked into the nozzles, not flowing out of them? It is recommended to look through the book <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i> (a partial Russian translation can be found in the <a href="http://ilyam.org/Feynman_3rd_IYPT_Nauka_i_zizn_12_1986_85-90.pdf"><i>“Nauka i zhizn”</i> magazine, 1986, No. 12</a>.) </p>

<p><b>9. Franklin’s wheel</b><br />Rotation of a little metal bar with pointed spearheads in a well-known “Franklin’s wheel experiment” is explained by the existence of “electric wind”. Explain why the wheel rotates if one places it between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor and charges the capacitor with an electrostatic generator. If the Franklin’s wheel is replaced with a dielectric disk, will such a disk rotate between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor charged with an electrostatic generator?</p>

<p><b>10. Electret</b><br />150 years ago, M. Faraday predicted electrets as electrostatic analogues to permanent magnets. Manufacture an electret and research its properties.</p>

<p><b>11. Color of a cloud</b><br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Clouds in the skies above, heavenly wanderers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long strings of snowy pearls stretched over azure plains!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exiles like I, you rush farther and farther on...”</i><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M. Yu. Lermontov<br />
Explain the observed colors of white clouds and rain bearing clouds.</p>

<p><b>12. Border of a cloud</b><br />An observed border of a cloud is often sharp. It is especially evident from onboard an airplane. Evaluate the “diffuseness” of the cloud’s border.</p>

<p><b>13. Cosmonauts cloud</b> (a fantasy with physical sense)<br />A large number of cosmonauts form a “cosmonauts cloud” in the outer space. Initially each of them has a football with him. Starting from a certain moment, cosmonauts begin throwing these balls one to another (without losing them). Describe the evolution of the “cosmonauts cloud”. In order not to limit your imagination, we offer you to choose on your own the initial conditions, the rules of throwing the balls, and other parameters of the “cloud”. The only important aspects are that the choice of model should be logically validated; the conclusions should be supported with quantitative estimations; the number of described evolutions should not exceed two.</p>

<p><b>14. Fractal?</b><br />A grandmother is winding woolen thread into a spherical thread ball. How does the mass of the ball depend on its diameter?</p>

<p><b>15. Light in a tube</b><br />Look through a glass tube at a light (tube diameter is ca. 5 mm, length is ca. 25 cm.) Explain the origin of the observed circles.</p>

<p><b>16. Interference</b><br />Take two photo plates (9&#215;12 cm), well-washed from emulsion. If they are tightly pressed (lapped) one to another, the interference bands can be observed in the reflected light. If the plates are laid on the table and the upper one is pressed in the middle part with a finger, the interference pattern looks like concentric circles. When the finger is removed, the circles “run away” from the centre. Carry out such an experiment and explain the observed phenomena. Evaluate theoretically how fast do the circles “run away” as the loading is removed.</p>

<p><b>17. Scientific Organization of Labor — SOL</b><br />You have to hammer 1989 similar nails (<i>l</i>=50 mm, <i>d</i>=2.5 mm) into a wooden bar. What hammer would you choose to perform this job quicker and better? (More specifically: what are the mass of the hammer and the length of its handle?)

<p><b>1. Invent yourself</b><br />Propose a cycle of demonstrations and experiments that can help to explain and visually demonstrate the physical nature of sound waves and the properties of sound.</p>

<p><b>2. Fortune teller</b><br />When molten paraffin is made to drip from a candle into a saucer with water, different solidified shapes are obtained, like a “lens”, a “boat”, an “inkblot”. Study the shape of the solidified droplets in dependence of altitude of their fall.</p>

<p><b>3. Geyser</b><br />A strong ceramic resistor in the shape of a hollow cylinder is placed into water so that the axis of the cylinder is vertical, and the top plane is slightly below the water level. If electric current is passed through the resistor, the resistor, just like a geyser, periodically ejects portions of hot water upwards. Calculate and study experimentally the dependence of the eruption periods of the “geyser” on the power consumed by the resistor from the power supply unit.</p>

<p><b>4. Self excitation</b><br />A strong hum sometimes happens on the concerts of newbie rock bands, when the microphone appears close to the speaker that reproduces the signals amplified from this very microphone. How do the frequency and the amplitude of the produced sound oscillations depend on the distance between the microphone and the speaker, and on their mutual orientation?</p>

<p><b>5. Cosmic monument</b><br />A particular supercivilization is eager to create a cosmic monument, an isolated planetary system of three planets, of which one should move along a trajectory close to an equilateral triangle.

You are to construct, make and demonstrate the electromagnetic gun. It is worth mentioning that the demonstration of your gun will take place with the power supply (elements S, C and K) presented by the Organizing Committee of the YPT. Develop two variants of the gun:</p> 

<p><b>9. A long-range gun</b> is to be constructed to shoot a ring to a maximum altitude.

<small>Problems selected at an uknown time in 1993, possibly in Russian<br /></small>

<small><a href="../solutions/#1994">Exemplary solutions for 1994 &rarr;</a><br /></small>

<p><b>Think up a problem yourself</b> (problems 1, 2, 3). Invent yourself and solve a problem on the given theme.</p>

<p><b>1. Optics</b><br />Think up and solve a problem connected with employing a thin lens of a large focal length.</p>

<p><b>2. Compass</b><br />“In sledge trips we use liquid compasses, the most exact of the small ones. But you understand of course that due to proximity to the magnetic pole the arrow usually points downwards. To make it horizontal, its opposite end is balanced with a weight.” (From the letter of Cherry-Garrad, member of the last expedition of R. Scott). Use the context of this quotation to formulate a problem.</p>

<p><b>3. Magnetism</b><br />A cylindrical permanent magnet falling inside a copper tube is found to move at an almost constant velocity, the slower the thicker and the walls of the tube. Use this fact to formulate a problem (See also 14).</p>

<p><b>Gravitation machine</b> (problems 4, 5, 6). A horizontal plate (a vibrator) oscillates harmonically up and down. A steel ball put an the surface of the plate starts jumping higher or lower. For the experimental device one may successfully use a ferrite core in a coil connected to an alternating current generator (a sound generator). The butt-end of the ferrite core will play the part of the vibrating horizontal plane. Steel balls of diameter 1 or 2 mm are suitable for the experiment. The glass tube approximately 1 m long can also be very helpful.</p>

<p><b>4. Upper boundary</b><br />Measure experimentally the maximum height to which the ball rises to and explain the result.</p>

<p><b>5. Distribution function</b><br />Determine experimentally what part of a sufficiently large time interval the ball is in the range of heights <i>H</i>, <i>H</i>+d<i>H</i> and explain the result.</p>

<p><b>6. Acceleration</b><br />The mechanical energy of the ball changes after every impact. The mean mechanical energy (averaged over all successive impacts) increases at the beginning of the process and then tends to a constant value. Try to obtain experimentally the time dependence of the mean mechanical energy of the ball.</p>

<p><b>7. Aspen leaf</b><br />Even in windless weather aspen leaves tremble slightly. Why does an aspen leaf tremble?</p>

<p><b>8. Superball</b><br />A highly elastic ball (a superball) falls on a horizontal surface from a small height (5 cm or less) and recoils several times. What is the number of impacts of the superball against a table?</p> 

<p><b>9. Meteorite</b></br />A meteorite of mass 1000 tons flies directly into the Sun. Can modern instruments register the fact of its fall on the Sun?</p>

<p><b>10. Water dome</b></br />A vertical water jet falls on the butt-end of a cylindrical bar and creates a bell-like water dome. Explain this phenomenon and evaluate the parameters of the dome.</p>

<p><b>11. Siphon</b><br />A rubber tube is used as a siphon to flow water from one vessel into another. The vessels are separated by a high partition and the levels of water in them are different. If one withdraws the tube from one vessel, lets the pole of air enter it and then puts the tube into the water again, the action of the siphon may be resumed or not. Investigate this phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>12. Boiling</b><br />Put a metallic ball heated to the temperature 150 &#176;C — 200 &#176;C into hot water at the temperature close to 100 &#176;C and observe the process of intensive evaporation of the water. Explain the observed phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>13. Spirits</b><br />A closed vessel (a bottle) contains spirits — pure or substantially diluted by water. Suggest a method of estimation of the concentration of spirits without opening the vessel.</p>

<p><b>14. Magnetic friction</b><br />To investigate the phenomenon described in the problem 3 we suggest to create the device containing the following elements:

<ol type="a"><li>a copper plate (or a set of plates) 0.3 to 15 mm thick. The length and the width of the plate may be chosen according to one’s convenience, but they should be large enough to avoid the effect of the boundaries;</li>
<li>a cylindrical electromagnet with a flat butt-end;</li><li>a device providing free motion of the flat butt-end of the electric magnet over the horizontal surface of the copper plate. It is very important that the gap between the magnet and the plate is small as possible and constant everywhere;</li><li>the push providing the uniform motion of the magnet at a given velocity over the plate surface.</li></ol>

Introduce the following notation: <i>T</i> — the push (and the force of magnetic friction), <i>v</i> — the velocity of the magnet, <i>h</i> — the thickness of the plate. Investigate and determine experimentally the dependence of <i>T</i> on <i>h</i> at <i>v</i>=const for several values of <i>v</i>.</p>

<p><b>15. Transmission of energy</b><br />Transmit without wires to a distance of 3 meters the largest possible part of the energy stored in a capacitor having capacity of <i>C</i>=10 &#956;F charged to voltage <i>U</i>=100 V. Measure this energy. Your device should not contain energy sources. Naturally the capacitor itself must not be transported.</p>

<p><b>16. The Moon and the Sun</b><br />“If you are asked what is more important, The Sun or the Moon, you should answer the Moon. For the Sun shines in daytime when there is enough light without it,” says a joke. When is it possible to see the Sun and the Moon at the same time? Calculate the schedule of the events for the European countries during 1994.</p>

<p><b>17. Straw</b><br />The Russian proverb says: “Had I known the place where I fell, I would have laid some straw there.” How much straw should be laid to guarantee a safe fall?</p>

<p align="right"><i>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here?”</br>“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,”
said the Cat.</i><br />Lewis Carroll</p>

<p><b>1. Packing</b><br />The fraction of space occupied by granular particles depends on their shape. Pour non-spherical particles such as rice, matches, or <i>M&M’s</i> candies into a box. How do characteristics like coordination number, orientational order, or the random close packing fraction depend on the relevant parameters?</p>

<p><b>2. Plume of smoke</b><br />If a burning candle is covered by a transparent glass, the flame extinguishes and a steady upward stream of smoke is produced. Investigate the plume of smoke at various magnifications.</p>

<p><b>3. Artificial muscle</b><br />Attach a polymer fishing line to an electric drill and apply tension to the line. As it twists, the fibre will form tight coils in a spring-like arrangement.

<p><b>5. Two balloons</b><br />Two rubber balloons are partially inflated with air and connected together by a hose with a valve. It is found that depending on initial balloon volumes, the air can flow in different directions. Investigate this phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>6. Magnus glider</b><br />Glue the bottoms of two light cups together to make a glider. Wind an elastic band around the centre and hold the free end that remains. While holding the glider, stretch the free end of the elastic band and then release the glider. Investigate its motion.</p>

<p><b>7. Shaded pole</b><br />Place a non-ferromagnetic metal disk over an electromagnet powered by an AC supply. The disk will be repelled, but not rotated. However, if a non-ferromagnetic metal sheet is partially inserted between the electromagnet and the disk, the disk will rotate. Investigate the phenomenon.</br>

<p><b>9. Hovercraft</b><br />A simple model hovercraft can be built using a CD and a balloon filled with air attached via a tube. Exiting air can lift the device making it float over a surface with low friction. Investigate how the relevant parameters influence the time of the ‘low-friction’ state.</p>

<p><b>10. Singing blades of grass</b><br />It is possible to produce a sound by blowing across a blade of grass, a paper strip or similar. Investigate this effect.</p>

<p><b>11. Cat’s whisker</b><br />The first semiconductor diodes, widely used in crystal radios, consisted of a thin wire that lightly touched a crystal of a semiconducting material (e.g. galena). Build your own ‘cat’s-whisker’ diode and investigate its electrical properties.</p>

<p><b>12. Thick lens</b><br />A bottle filled with a liquid can work as a lens. Arguably, such a bottle is dangerous if left on a table on a sunny day. Can one use such a ‘lens’ to scorch a surface?</p>

<p><b>13. Magnetic pendulum</b><br />Make a light pendulum with a small magnet at the free end. An adjacent electromagnet connected to an AC power source of a much higher frequency than the natural frequency of the pendulum can lead to undamped oscillations with various amplitudes. Study and explain the phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>14. Circle of light</b><br />When a laser beam is aimed at a wire, a circle of light can be observed on a screen perpendicular to the wire. Explain this phenomenon and investigate how it depends on the relevant parameters.</p>

<p><b>15. Moving brush</b><br />A brush may start moving when placed on a vibrating horizontal surface. Investigate the motion.</p>

<p><b>16. Wet and dark</b><br />Clothes can look darker or change colour when they get wet. Investigate the phenomenon.</p>

<p><b>17. Coffee cup</b><br />Physicists like drinking coffee, however walking between laboratories with a cup of coffee can be problematic. Investigate how the shape of the cup, speed of walking and other parameters affect the likelihood of coffee being spilt while walking.</p>

<p><b>12. Van der Pauw method</b><br />It is known that conductivity of a material can be measured independently of the sample shape, as long as the sample has one border (no holes). To what extent can such a method be applied? Investigate and explain such measurements if the sample has holes.</p>

<p><b>13. Paper vice</b><br />Take two similar paperback books and interleave a few pages at a time. Push the books together. Hold the two books by their 
spines and try to pull them apart. Investigate the parameters that set the limits of being able to separate the books.</p>

<p><b>14. Sensitive flame</b><br />A combustible gas (e.g. propane) streams vertically out of a fine nozzle and then through a fine metallic mesh at a distance of about 5 cm. The gas is lit and produces a flame above the mesh. Under some circumstances, this flame reacts very sensitively to sound. Investigate the phenomenon and the relevant parameters.</p>

<p><b>15. Contactless calliper</b><br />Invent and construct an optical device that uses a laser pointer and allows contactless determination of thickness, refractive index, and other properties of a glass sheet.</p>

<p><b>16. Frisbee vortices</b><br />When a vertical plate is partially submerged in water and pulled in a direction normal to the plate, a pair of vortices is created in the surface of the water. Under certain conditions, these vortices travel along the surface for a long distance. Investigate the parameters influencing the motion and stability of these vortices.</p>

<p><b>17. Crazy suitcase</b><br />When one pulls along a two wheeled suitcase, it can under certain circumstances wobble so strongly from side to side that it can turn over. Investigate this phenomenon. Can one suppress or intensify the effect by varied packing of the luggage?</p>
